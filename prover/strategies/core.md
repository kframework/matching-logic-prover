Core Strategy Language
======================

The "strategy" language is an imperative language for describing which
high-level proof rules to try, in an attempt to find a proof.
Strategies can be composed: by sequencing via the `;` strategy;
as alternatives picking the first one that succeeds via the `|` strategy;
or, by requiring several strategies succeed.

```k
module PROVER-CORE-SYNTAX
```

```k
  syntax Strategy ::= Strategy ";" Strategy [right]
                    | "(" Strategy ")"      [bracket]
                    | TerminalStrategy
                    | ResultStrategy
  syntax ResultStrategy ::= "noop"
                          | TerminalStrategy
                          | Strategy "&" Strategy [right, format(%1%n%2  %3)]
                          | Strategy "|" Strategy [right, format(%1%n%2  %3)]
```

TODO: Should we allow `success` and `fail` in the program syntax? All other
strategies (assuming correct implementation) only allow for constructing a sound
proof.

```k
  syntax TerminalStrategy ::= "success" | "fail"
```

```k
endmodule
```

```k
module PROVER-CORE
  imports PROVER-CONFIGURATION
```

```k
  imports PROVER-CORE-SYNTAX
```

`Strategy`s can be sequentially composed via the `;` operator.

```k
  rule <strategy> (S ; T) ; U => S ; (T ; U) ... </strategy>
```

Since strategies do not live in the K cell, we must manually heat and cool.
`ResultStrategy`s are strategies that can only be simplified when they are
cooled back into the sequence strategy.

```k
  syntax ResultStrategy ::= "#hole"
  rule <strategy> S1 ; S2 => S1 ~> #hole ; S2 ... </strategy>
    requires notBool(isResultStrategy(S1))
  rule <strategy> S1:ResultStrategy ~> #hole ; S2 => S1 ; S2 ... </strategy>
```

The `noop` (no operation) strategy is the unit for sequential composition:

```k
  rule <strategy> noop ; T => T ... </strategy>
```

The `success` and `fail` strategy indicate that a goal has been successfully
proved, or that constructing a proof has failed.

```k
  rule <strategy> T:TerminalStrategy ; S => T ... </strategy>
```

The `goalStrat(GoalId)` strategy is used to establish a reference to the result of
another goal. It's argument holds the id of a subgoal. Once that subgoal has
completed, its result is replaced in the parent goal and the subgoal is removed.

```k
  syntax Strategy ::= goalStrat(GoalId)
  rule <prover>
         <goal> <id> PID </id>
                <active> _ => true </active>
                <strategy> goalStrat(ID) => RStrat ... </strategy>
                ...
         </goal>
         ( <goal> <id> ID </id>
                  <active> true:Bool </active>
                  <parent> PID </parent>
                  <strategy> RStrat:TerminalStrategy </strategy>
                  ...
           </goal> => .Bag
         )
         ...
       </prover>
```

Proving a goal may involve proving other subgoals:

```k
  syntax Strategy ::= "subgoal" "(" Pattern "," Strategy ")"
  rule <prover>
         ( .Bag =>
             <goal>
               <id> !ID:Int </id>
               <active> true </active>
               <parent> PARENT </parent>
               <strategy> SUBSTRAT </strategy>
               <k> SUBGOAL </k>
               <trace> TRACE </trace>
               ...
             </goal>
         )
         <goal>
           <id> PARENT </id>
           <active> true => false </active>
           <strategy> subgoal(SUBGOAL, SUBSTRAT) => goalStrat(!ID:Int) ... </strategy>
           <trace> TRACE </trace>
           ...
         </goal>
         ...
       </prover>
```

Sometimes, we may need to combine the proofs of two subgoals to construct a proof
of the main goal. The `&` strategy generates subgoals for each child strategy, and if
all succeed, it succeeds:

```k
  rule <strategy> S & fail => fail ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> fail & S => fail ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> S & success => S ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> success & S => S ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> (S1 & S2) ; S3 => (S1 ; S3) & (S2 ; S3) ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> T:TerminalStrategy ~>  #hole & S2
               => T & S2
                  ...
       </strategy>
  rule <prover>
         <goal>
           <strategy> ((S1 & S2) => subgoal(GOAL, S1) ~> #hole & S2) </strategy>
           <k> GOAL:Pattern </k>
           ...
         </goal>
         ...
       </prover>
    requires notBool(isTerminalStrategy(S1))
     andBool notBool(isTerminalStrategy(S2))
```

Similarly, there may be a different approaches to finding a proof for a goal.
The `|` strategy lets us try these different approaches, and succeeds if any one
approach succeeds:

```k
  rule <strategy> S | fail => S ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> fail | S => S ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> S | success => success ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> success | S => success ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> (S1 | S2) ; S3 => (S1 ; S3) | (S2 ; S3) ... </strategy>
  rule <strategy> T:TerminalStrategy ~>  #hole | S2
               => T | S2
                  ...
       </strategy>
  rule <prover>
         <goal>
           <strategy> ((S1 | S2) => subgoal(GOAL, S1) ~> #hole | S2 ) </strategy>
           <k> GOAL:Pattern </k>
           ...
         </goal>
         ...
       </prover>
    requires notBool(isTerminalStrategy(S1))
     andBool notBool(isTerminalStrategy(S2))
```

If-then-else-fi strategy is useful for implementing other strategies:

```k
  syntax Strategy ::= "if" Bool "then" Strategy "else" Strategy "fi" [function]
  rule if true  then S1 else _  fi => S1
  rule if false then _  else S2 fi => S2
endmodule
```
